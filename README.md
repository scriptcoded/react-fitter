# react-fitter

In a project of mine I had to fit some text of unknown length to a container
without it wrapping. This utility component does exactly that, regardless of
whether if it sits inline, in a flexbox, grid or table. It just works.

```bash
npm install react-fitter
```

Usage:
```jsx
import {Â Fitter } from 'react-fitter'

// ...

<div className="my-text">
  <Fitter>
    This is some text that will perfectly fit in the container
  </Fitter>
</div>
```

And your CSS can be whatever you want. The Fitter component will never make the
text larger than what's set by your styles. It will only ever make it smaller.
```css
.my-text {
  width: 400px;
  font-size: 24px;
  border: 1px solid hotpink;
}
```

Which would look like this:

In contrast to how it would look without react-fitter:
